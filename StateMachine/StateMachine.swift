/// A type representing schema that can be reused by `StateMachine`
/// instances.
///
/// The schema incorporates three generic types: `State` and `Event`,
/// which should be `enum`s, and `Subject`, which represents an object
/// associated with a state machine.  If you don't want to associate any
/// object, use `Void` as `Subject` type.
///
/// The schema indicates the initial state and describes the transition
/// logic, i.e. how states are connected via events and what code is
/// executed during state transitions.  You specify transition logic
/// as a block that accepts two arguments: the current state and the
/// event being handled.  It returns an optional tuple of a new state
/// and an optional transition block.  When the tuple is `nil`, it
/// indicates that there is no transition for a given state-event pair,
/// i.e. a given event should be ignored in a given state.  When the
/// tuple is non-`nil`, it specifies the new state that the machine
/// should transition to and a block that should be called after the
/// transition.  The transition block is optional and it gets passed
/// the `Subject` object as an argument.
